# SQL Analysis for Human Resources
## Overview
This analysis is designed to give an engineering firm HR manager a snapshot of the business from 1980-1990. PostgreSQL is used to query the database, populating a variety of tables. 

## Index
"Resources" folder houses all original csv files. The "employeeSQL" folder holds the entity relationship diagram and Postgres code 

## Process
  ### Data Engineering
  - Table schemas are developed from existing CSV files
  - Datatypes, foreign keys, and primary keys are mapped to establish the relational database
  ### Data Analysis
  - Filter employee demographic info by year
  - Filter department information by manager
  - Filter employees by name and department
  - Count and compare department size over time

## Results

Further exploration could include creating visuals in tableau to illustrate company growth, turnover rates by department, or gender equality by title and salary over time.
